Surfs Up Climate Analysis

Overview of the statistical analysis:
The purpose the analysis is to understand the temperature statistics for June and December to find out if owning a surf shop can be successful year-round.  I ran 2 queries to get temperatures for June and for December for the years 2010 - 2016, stored them as a list, then converted them to a data frame.  I summarized the findings with describe() method.

Results:

•	Between the years of 2010 and 2016, the average temperature for June has been 75 degrees with a standard deviation of 3.25.  
 
•	Between 2010 and 2016, the average temperature for December has been 71 degrees with a standard deviation of 3.75.
 
•	Even December temperatures have reached as low as 56 degrees in the past, 50% of the temperatures have been 71 degrees while in June it’s been 75 degrees with the difference in standard deviation of only .5.   

Summary:
Our findings provide us insight into understanding what temperatures are, but this is not enough to decide.  We still need to understand precipitation and other weather-related data to get a full breadth of climate for the surf shop.
